## 🎯 Why Gramin Saathi? What Makes It Different?

### ❌ The Old Way (Still How Most Farmers Manage Finances)
- 📝 Paper ledgers (बही-खाता) that get lost or eaten by insects
- 🤔 Don't know which government schemes you qualify for (missing ₹10,000-₹50,000 annually!)
- 📞 Ask village elders/agents → get wrong advice → lose money
- 🌾 No idea if crops will fail → buy expensive insurance at wrong time
- 📱 Need Android phone → internet is slow/expensive
- 💬 Ask questions → no one understands your local language well

### ✅ The Gramin Saathi Way (Smart, Simple, Free)
- 📱 **Digital Ledger with Voice** - Just speak in Hindi/English to record transactions
- 🏛️ **AI Finds Your Benefits** - ₹35,000+/year from 16+ government schemes (auto-matched)
- 🛡️ **Smart Insurance Advisor** - Know exactly which insurance you need (saves ₹10-50K)
- 💰 **AI Loan Finder** - Get lowest-interest loans (₹50K-₹3L) matched to your farm
- 📊 **Live Market Prices** - 30,000+ mandis, real-time rates
- 🌤️ **Weather + Farm Tips** - 5-day forecast with actionable advice
- 📚 **Learn Finance** - Free courses from Government of India
- 🔊 **100% Hindi Support** - Not English-only like other apps
- 💻 **Works Offline** - No internet? Features still work!
