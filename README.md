# SabkaAI: AI for Inclusion Hackathon (AI Impact Summit 2026 – Official Pre-Summit Event)

This repository maintains the official record of **SabkaAI: AI for Inclusion Hackathon**, successfully concluded by the  
**TIET–UQ Centre of Excellence in Data Science & AI (CoDSaI)** as an **Official Pre-Summit Event of the AI Impact Summit 2026**.

---

## Problem Statement

The objective of the hackathon was to encourage students to design and prototype **AI-powered solutions for inclusion**, with emphasis on:

- AI for Financial Literacy to Rural People
- Multilingual and Multimodal Accessibility Tools
- AI Tutors for Schools
- Bias-Free AI for Recruitment
- AI for Energy Saving
- Open Challenge: AI for Inclusion

---

## Key Takeaway (Day 1 Discussion)

> AI will not replace people — but people must focus on building **user-centric, secure, and ethical AI systems**, beyond only coding skills.

---

## Outcomes & Impact

Across two days, students collaborated to build meaningful AI solutions and prototypes focused on inclusion and real-world usability.  
The diversity of ideas, along with the depth of responsibility and ethical awareness demonstrated by the teams, highlighted how inclusive AI is not just a concept—it is actively being built by today’s students.
